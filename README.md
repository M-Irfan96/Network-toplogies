Week 1 â€“ Networking Basics and Topologies

Objective
Understand networking concepts, create network topology diagrams, and identify key networking devices.
Network Topologies

1. Star Topology
 	All devices connect to a central hub/switch.  
 	Easy to set up, scalable, and faults are isolated.  
 	If the central hub fails, the entire network fails.  
 	Small office LANs.

2. Bus Topology
 	Devices are connected in a single line (shared backbone).  
 	Simple, low cost.  
 	Collisions increase with more devices; difficult troubleshooting.  
 	Early LANs, small temporary networks.

3. Mesh Topology
 	Every device connects to every other device.  
 	High reliability, no single point of failure.  
 	Expensive, complex wiring.  
 	Data centers, military communication.

4. Ring Topology
 	Each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a circular path for data to travel.  
 	Simple to install, predictable data transmission, and better performance than bus topology under heavy load.  
 	Failure of a single device or link can disrupt the entire network; troubleshooting is 
 	Older LANs, campus networks, and some WAN implementations (e.g., SONET, FDDI).
Networking Devices

 Router : Connects different networks and directs data packets
.  

Switch: Connects devices in a LAN, forwards data intelligently using MAC addresses. 
 
 
Firewall: Provides network security by filtering traffic (hardware/software).  
 
Hub : A basic device that broadcasts data to all connected devices.  
 
Access Point: Provides wireless connectivity to devices.  
 
Modem : Converts digital signals to analog for ISP communication.
